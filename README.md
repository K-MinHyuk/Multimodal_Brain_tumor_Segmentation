# Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation
Brain tumors are fatal to humans and challenging to diagnose via MRI. 

The goal is to construct a more effective Brain Tumor Segmentation model based on state-of-the-art models proposed in the Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge.

Do you know about the BraTS challenge?

The BraTS Challenge stands for the Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge, an international competition focused on the segmentation of brain tumors. 

It occupies a significant position in the field of medical imaging analysis, offering researchers the opportunity to compare and evaluate their algorithms and methodologies against those of others from around the globe.

Primarily centered on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data, participants in the BraTS Challenge are tasked with developing algorithms that can accurately identify and segment brain tumors within given MRI scans. The challenge aims to advance high-precision imaging analysis techniques essential for accurate diagnosis, classification, and subsequent treatment planning of brain tumors.

Given the complexity of distinguishing brain tumors, the data can utilize multi-modality data including Flair, T1, T1c, and T2. We aim to segment the various stages of brain tumors as illustrated in the figure above. As a result of the project, it's observed that each input data type offers advantages in segmenting specific tumor stages.
